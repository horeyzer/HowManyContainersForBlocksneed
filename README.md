# HowManyContainersForBlocksneed
Choose an odd number between 50 and 100 and save it as an int variable telling us how many Lego bricks we have (e.g. amountOfBricks), then select an even number between 5 and 10 stating how many Lego blocks fit in one container (e.g.: containerCapacity) and save it as an int variable as well.
Write a program that will calculate how many full containers we have and how many containers in general (full and not full), and how many blocks are in the container that is not completely full (use modulo operator for this).
Each of the above actions should be listed on the console, explaining what has been done.
